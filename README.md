# SMS-Spam-Detection-Model-


SMS Spam Classifier
This project is a simple yet effective machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
It uses the Naive Bayes classifier along with TF-IDF vectorization to learn from text patterns.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Classifies SMS messages into spam or ham

âœ… Trained on the classic UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset (~5,500 messages)

âœ… Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text to numerical features

âœ… Uses Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier

âœ… Saves trained model and vectorizer using joblib

âœ… Interactive input mode for testing custom messages


Component        	Library
Language  	      Python 3.x
Data handling	    pandas
Text processing  	NLTK (stopwords), scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Naive Bayes)
Visualization   	seaborn, matplotlib
Model saving  	  joblib


Accuracy: ~98% on test set

Precision (Spam): High (model minimizes false positives)

Recall (Spam): High (model catches most spam messages)


Improve ------

Train on a larger, more diverse dataset (e.g. Enron, extended SMS collections)
